# Web server

This is a collaborate project for Java training, conducted by [8th
Light](http://www.8thlight.com/).

The goal is to implement an HTTP web server from scratch in Java.

The goal is reached when the server passes the tests provided by [Cob
Spec](https://github.com/8thlight/cob_spec).

## Building the JAR

    $ mvn package
    $ jar -jar jars/server-1.0.jar
